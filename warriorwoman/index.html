<div><h3>Warrior Woman</h3></div>
<div class="purple"><p>In 1960, the city of Toronto tore down blocks of buildings in old Chinatown to make way for the new City Hall Queen and Dundas Street, once owned by my father, escaped destruction. The old hotel, once owned by my father's uncle, crumbled under the wrecker's ball. My mother took me to see a movie in old Chinatown, before the city tore down the old movie theatre.</p>
    <div class="violet">
        <p>My mother rarely dressed up to go out. I watched her get ready to go to the movie. She stood in the kitchen and looked into the mirror of the small wooden cabinet that held our toothbrushes. On the counter below, she placed a small pot of rouge, a red lipstick, a compact of face powder and a small silky powder puff. My mother leaned closer to the mirror and examined her eyes. She ran her fingertips slowly over her eyebrows.</p>
        <div class="coral"><p>My mother pulled open the cabinet drawer and took out a spool of thread. She unwound a length of thread and doubled it, attached one end of the thread to the cabinet and held the doubled end in one hand, winding the loose end of the thread around the fingers of her other hand. Holding the doubled thread against her eyebrows and twirling it between her fingers, she caught a stray hair between the twisted threads. With a quick thug, my mother plucked the offending hair from her eyebrows. She shaped each eyebrow into a graceful arch.</p></div><p>
Next, my mother smeared a dab of rouge on her cheeks and rubbed it into her skin until her cheeks glowed. She patted the powder puff on her cheeks and around her nose. Then she carefully outlined her lips with the tip of the red lipstick. She stopped to examine her lips. Satisfied, she completed painting her lips with the red lipstick. For the final touch, she darkened her eyebrows with the charred tip of a burnt wooden match.</p>
    </div><p>My mother buttoned the back of my dress and tied a bow behind me. I tugged at my white socks and straightened the strap on my shiny black patent shoes. Dressed and ready, I impatiently watched my mother fasten the clasp on her gold-and-jade bracelet and then clip her gold-and-jade earrings to her ears. She straightened her dress, pushed aside the curtain hanging over her bedroom door and stepped into the hall.</p><div class="violet"><p>"Hurry!" my mother said. “Hong’s wife is waiting. “We were going to the movies with Cousin Hong's wife. I had never gone to the movies before. My mother walked quickly down Phoebe Street, her high heels clicking on the concrete sidewalk. I walked beside her and stepped over the cracks in the concrete.<br><p><em> Step on a crack and break your mother's back.</em></p></p><div class="coral"><p>My cousin and his family lived on McCaul Street, about fifteen-minute walk from our house. Cousin Hong drank. My sister E told me how one night Hong's wife hid behind a door with a broomstick, waiting to attack him when he came home drunk. Hong's wife had a name, but we called her Hong's wife because that was her position in the family. We walked up Huron Street, across Sullivan Street and turned the corner at Beverley Street. We walked past the art gallery toward McCaul, past the used clothing store and the store that sold live chickens and around the corner to my cousin's house.</p></div><p>'Coming to the movie?' Hong's Wife asked. She did not wait for me to answer. She turned to my mother. I did not listen to their gossip. I thought only of the movie. From McCaul, my mother, Hong's wife and I walked to old Chinatown, near the intersection of Dundas and Elizabeth.
</p></div><p>We walked into the dimly lit theatre, its empty seats lined in rows before us. I followed my mother to the front row. She held the seat down for me. I sat on the red plush seat, sinking into the upholstery, my feet dangling, and stared up at the stage, draped with heavy red curtains.</p><div class="violet"><p>The theatre darkened while the heavy red curtains slowly rose to reveal a large blank white screen. I waited for the movie to start.</p><div class="coral"><p>Chinese characters, bright white against the brilliant colors, flashed across the screen. The strains of stringed music, unfamiliar, whining and plaintive, filled the air.</p></div><p>Warrior Woman leapt on the screen. Warrior Woman floated through the air like a cloud, white silk flowing around her like wispy trails of smoke. Red lips, glowing cheeks, painted eyes and soaring eyebrows, emphasized her powdered white face. She shouted at her opponent. I could not understand what she said. Warrior Woman stood, her head tilted, hand on her sword, challenging her enemy with her stance. Chinese subtitles lined the bottom of the screen for anyone who could not understand the Chinese dialect spoken by the actors.</p></div><p>I could not read the subtitles, but it did not matter. I understood Warrior Woman. She defeated all who challenged her. Men shouted as they charged Warrior Woman, but she fearlessly fought them off. I turned my head and looked at my mother to see if she was watching Warrior Woman. My mother's head tilted slightly to one side, her eyes closed while she slept. I turned back to the screen and watched Warrior Woman battle another foe.</p><div class="violet">
<p>The movie ended when Warrior Woman defeated all her enemies. Warrior Woman stood, victorious in battle, feet astride the rocky crest of a hill, one hand on her hip, the other arm raised with sword in hand catching the sunlight, a blinding glare glancing of its deadly blade. Then rows of Chinese characters rolled up the screen, concealing Warrior Woman's defiant gaze.</p>
    <div class="coral"><p>As we walked up the aisle to the exit, I looked back. The heavy red curtains slowly lowered to cover the screen, sealing off Warrior Woman's world.</p></div>
    <p>We walked out into the street, shielding our eyes from the bright sunlight. We walked across a large empty lot bounded on the south by Queen Street and on the east by Bay street. We walked toward Queen Street, TTC streetcars visible in the distance. My mother held my hand as we stepped on the bits of stone and rubble from recently demolished buildings. She gossiped with Hong's Wife and paid little attention to me.</p>
</div><p>Walking hand-in-hand with my mother felt natural. I imagined how we looked. I thought about the eight-by-ten photographs of my two American cousins who live in Chicago. We had photographs of sisters, dressed in matching outfits, smiling for the camera, walking along the street, reaching up to hold their mother's white-gloved hands.
</p><div class="violet">The perfect picture faded. My mother never took me to see a movie again. My mother never walked hand in hand with me again. Whenever I looked at the family photo album, I could not avoid the last pages, dominated by the eight-by-ten photographs of my American cousins. They looked like part of the perfect American family. The perfection captured in their photographs seemed a distant dream to me.</div>
