<div><h3>Warrior Woman</h3></div>
<div class="purple"><p>In 1960, the city of Toronto tore down blocks of buildings in old Chinatown to make way for the new City Hall Queen and Dundas Street,, once owned by my father, escaped destruction. The old hotel, once owned by my father's uncle, crumbled under the wrecker's ball. My mother took me to see a movie in old Chinatown, before the city tore down the old movie theatre.</p>
    <div class="violet">
        <p>My mother rarely dressed up to go out. I watched her get ready to go to the movie. She stood in the kitchen and looked into the mirror of the small wooden cabinet that held our toothbrushes. On the counter below, she placed a small pot of rouge, a red lipstick, a compact of face powder and a small silky powder puff. My mother leaned closer to the mirror and examined her eyes. She ran her fingertips slowly over her eyebrows.</p>
        <div class="coral"><p>My mother pulled open the cabinet drawer and took out a spool of thread. She unwound a lenght of thread and doubled it, attached one end of the thread to the cabinet and held the doubled end in one hand, winding the loose end of the thread around the fingers of her other hand. Holding the doubled thread against her eyebrows and twirling it between her fingers, she caught a stray hair between the twisted threads. With a quick thug,my mother plucked the offending hair from her eyebrows. She shaped each eyebrow into a graceful arch.</p></div><p>
Next, my mother smeared a dab of rouge on her cheeks and rubbed it into her skin until her cheeks glowed. She patted the powder puff on her cheeks and around her nose. Then she carefully outlined her lips with the tip of the red lipstick. She stopped to examine her lips. Satisfied, she completed painting her lips with the red lipstick. For the final touch, she darkened her eyebrows with the charred tip of a burnt wooden match.</p>
    </div><p>My mother buttoned the back of my dress and tied a bow behind me. I tugged at my white socks and straightened the strap on my shiny black patent shoes. Dressed and ready, I impatiently watched my mother fasten the clasp on her gold-and-jade bracelet and then clip her gold-and-jade earings to her ears. She straightened her dress, pushed aside the curtain hanging over her bedroom door and stepped into the hall.</p><div class="violet"><p>"Hurry!" my mother said."Hong's wife is waiting."We were going to the movies with Cousin Hong's wife. I had never gone to the movies before.My motherwalked quickly down Phoebe Street, her high heels clicking on the concrete sidewalk. I walked beside her Woman floated throu and stepped over the cracks in the concrete.<br><em> Step on a crack and break your mother's back.</em></p><div class="coral"><p>My cousin and his family lived on McCaul Street, about fifteen-minute walk from our house. Cousin Hong drank. My sister E told me how one night Hong's wife hid behind a door with a broomstick,waiting to attack him when he came home drunk. Hong's wife had a name, but we called her Hong's wife because that was her possition in the family. We walked up Huron Street, across Sullivan Street and turned the corner at Beverley Street. We walked past the art gallery toward McCaul, past the used clothing store and the store that sold live chickens and around the corner to my cousin's house.</p></div><p>'Coming to the movie?' Hong's Wife asked. She did not wait for me to answer. She turned to my mother. I did not listen to their gossip. I thought only of the movie.</p></div>
