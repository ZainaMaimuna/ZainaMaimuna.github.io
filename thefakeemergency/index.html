<div><h3>The <span id="h3italics"><em>Fake</em></span> Emergency
</h3></div>
<div class="maroon"><p class ="maroon">Aslio was a stylish talker. He loved speaking in a complex way. One day, he slipped on a banana peel and fell on the ground. He felt a bump on his head. He called the hospital’s helpline. A helpline-person picked up the phone and said, “Hello? This is the hospital’s emergency help….”. But before she could finish the rest of her sentence, Aslio interrupted her.” I <em>broke</em> my head” he said.” Come save me from this horror of the <em>bloody</em> head. The <em>heartbreak</em> is unforgiveable.” The helpline-person thought that he <em>really</em> broke his head, severely and also got heart problems. She rushed to the doctor and yelled” A man has broken his head and there’s something wrong with heart. His head is bleeding!!!”</p>
<p class="pinkishmaroon">The doctor told the ambulance driver to bring him to the hospital as fast as possible. So the driver went to Aslio. When he came, he was so angry to see that it was just a minor headache, he screamed at him and kicked him. Then the driver left and told the doctor and the helpline-person the real thing.</p></div>

<strong>getting</strong> <em>nothing.</em>
