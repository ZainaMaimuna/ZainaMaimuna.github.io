<h4 id="chapter1"class="ch">The Beginning</h4>
<p>Jonas Jenkins loved to take risks. So, he decided to make a clone of himself. He scanned his body and made similar components to make it. But, he was unaware of one thing. After he put artificial blood inside, he said "This looks just like me!!! So he should be like me." He turned it on...<br><br>
"Dr. Jenkins has been acting in a very weird way, these days." said Dr. Alison. He was the head of GTL, the company for which Jonas used to work. "He doesn’t deserve to work at a place like Great Tech Labs." said Dr. Espino. "Don't be so hard on him. " said Dr. Alison." Maybe, he’s been going through a lot of work. He must be tired. " "I wouldn’t say that if I were you" said Brian Jenkins, Jonas’s brother. "He’s been acting pretty weird out of the lab too. Even, at parties."<br><br>
"Maybe, we should check on him" said Dr. Espino. "I don’t think that’s a good idea, Robert" said Brian. "He goes crazy whenever somebody is near his lab." "We must take this risk" said Dr. Alison. "It’s our only chance." <br>So, Brian reluctantly agreed.<br>
    <br>That night, they slowly snuck into Jonas’s room. They hid behind the shelves, since there was no other good hiding place for them.Footsteps came rustling inside.<br><br>
"Be quiet" whispered Brian to the others. "If we get caught it would all be your fault, Robert!" Dr. Espino got really angry and whisper-yelled at him. "If you two keep fighting we would surely get caught" whispered Dr. Alison. "And it would all be your fault!"
<br><br>
"Shush" whispered Brian. "Look! I think he’s doing something!!!" They saw Jonas opening the new safe which an inch taller than him. The noise of a struggling prisoner filled their ears.<br>
"Be quiet" said the <em>clone…</em>
</p>
<h5 class="ch" id="chapter2">The Rescue</h5>
<p>"We can’t let that clone get away with this" said Brian, the next day. "If it weren’t for <em>you </em>we would have stopped him when we had the chance." "Calm down, Jenkins" said Dr. Alison. "If we tried to stop him, we would now be in the same place as your brother." "He’s got a point" said Dr. Espino. <br>"At least, we <em>had</em> the chance" said Brian. "Now we don’t even have that!"<br><br>
"Maybe that’s <em>not</em> true" said Dr. Espino. "There’s <em>still</em> a chance." Brian got confused. "Robert" said Brian. "What do you mean? How is it even <em>possible?</em> We already lost our chance, last night." "Don’t worry" said Dr. Alison. "Didn’t he tell you?" "No" said Brian. "What’s going on?" Dr. Alison looked at Dr. Espino with irritated eyes. "Umm" said Dr. Espino. "I <em>may</em> have forgot…" The moment he said the word "forgot" Dr. Alison screeched "I gave you only one job to do and you forgot!!!" Dr. Alison is usually a man of <em>great</em> calmness, but whenever he gets angry, he’s like a big volcano that keeps erupting forever.<br><br>
After about <em>an hour</em> or <em>more</em> of Dr. Alison’s anger at Dr. Espino, Brian finally asked "What was it that he was supposed to tell me?" "Well" Dr. Espino said, nervously. Dr. Alison looked at him with <em>eyes of thunder</em>, just waiting to <em>strike</em> with huge bolts of lightning. Frightened, Dr. Espino continued "We were thinking about how to save your brother and…" He stopped, <em>struck</em> by the <em>lightning</em> of Dr. Alison’s <em>frightening stare.</em> He gathered all of his strength and said "and we thought we could take help from <em>Jen.</em>" <br>Jen was the nickname of Jennifer Wilkins, a biologist and the head of the A.I branch of GTI.<br><br>
Later, they went to Jennifer’s room. "Dr. Wilkins" said Dr. Alison. "Please let us in." There was no answer. Dr. Alison had spoken pretty quietly but it was still clear. "Hey, Jen" yelled Brian and Dr. Espino. "Let us in!" "Be quiet, you two" said Dr. Alison. "A man from GTI should always remain <em>calm</em> and disciplined." Dr. Espino and Brian started giggling when he said <em>"calm"</em>. A voice came from the other room which asked "What’s going on?"<br><br>
Brian said "We were wondering if you could…" Jennifer interrupted him and said "Make a clone?" Brian said "We want you to <em>destroy</em> a clone." "What the heck" said Jennifer. "Where did even see a clone? Yesterday I told Jonas about how to make a clone. Later, he told me that he <em>destroyed</em> it. So it’s totally <em>impossible</em> that you saw that clone." So Dr. Espino, Dr. Alison and Brian told her about the previous night. <br>"So" said Jennifer. "That means <em>that</em> was the clone who said he destroyed himself. But why would he want to know the password of Dr. Jenkins’s old safe? And <em>why</em> did you <em>let</em> him torture Jonas like that?"<br><br>
"Well" said Dr. Espino.<br>"We weren’t prepared" said Dr. Alison. "It’s definitely too risky to do something without preparation." "It was an <em>emergency</em>, you morons" said Jennifer. "You don’t <em>calculate</em> risks when there’s an emergency!" "We <em>wanted</em> to help" said Brian and Dr. Espino. "He <em>didn’t</em> let us!" Dr. Alison felt highly insulted by all this accusation of the clone not being stopped his fault. He yelled "I <em>did</em> the right thing. If I wasn’t there, you two would be <em>roasted meat</em> by now!!! I <em>saved you</em> and <em>you</em> should be grateful!!!"<br><br>
Again after about an hour or more, <br>Dr. Alison <em>finally</em> calmed down. <br>Jennifer said "I think I <em>can</em> still help you."<br><br>
That night, they went to Jonas’s room again, <em>but this time</em> wearing clothes which were covered with water and high volts of electricity. They were <em>safe</em> from the electricity because there was a layer of plastic inside. They went inside and hid at the same place where they had hidden before. The clone came in. But <em>this</em> time, they didn’t stay hidden for long. When the clone opened the door of the new safe, they came out of hiding and pounced on the clone, who was <em>destroyed</em> the moment they touched him. They put on plastic overalls and quickly <em>freed</em> Jonas.<br><br>
Jonas asked them about how they destroyed the clone <em>just</em> by touching him. Brian said "The <strong>electricity</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>water</strong> from our clothes destroyed him. Jen can tell you more."<br><br>
"Hey look" said Jennifer. "I think someone hacked into your computer and changed the data stored for your clone."
