<h4 id="chapter1"class="ch">The Beginning</h4>
<p>Jonas Jenkins loved to take risks. So, he decided to make a clone of himself. He scanned his body and made similar components to make it. But, he was unaware of one thing. After he put artificial blood inside, he said "This looks just like me!!! So he should be like me." He turned it on...<br><br>
"Dr. Jenkins has been acting in a very weird way, these days." said Dr. Alison. He was the head of GTL, the company for which Jonas used to work. "He doesn’t deserve to work at a place like Great Tech Labs." said Dr. Espino. "Don't be so hard on him. " said Dr. Alison." Maybe, he’s been going through a lot of work. He must be tired. " "I wouldn’t say that if I were you" said Brian Jenkins, Jonas’s brother. "He’s been acting pretty weird out of the lab too. Even, at parties."<br><br>
"Maybe, we should check on him" said Dr. Espino. "I don’t think that’s a good idea, Robert" said Brian. "He goes crazy whenever somebody is near his lab." "We must take this risk" said Dr. Alison. "It’s our only chance." <br>So, Brian reluctantly agreed.<br>
    <br>That night, they slowly snuck into Jonas’s room. They hid behind the shelves, since there was no other good hiding place for them.Footsteps came rustling inside.<br><br>
"Be quiet" whispered Brian to the others. "If we get caught it would all be your fault, Robert!" Dr. Espino got really angry and whisper-yelled at him. "If you two keep fighting we would surely get caught" whispered Dr. Alison. "And it would all be your fault!"
<br><br>
"Shush" whispered Brian. "Look! I think he’s doing something!!!" They saw Jonas opening the new safe which an inch taller than him. The noise of a struggling prisoner filled their ears.<br>
"Be quiet" said the <em>clone…</em>
</p>
<h5 class="ch" id="chapter2">The Rescue</h5>
<p>"We can’t let that clone get away with this" said Brian, the next day. "If it weren’t for <em>you </em>we would have stopped him when we had the chance." "Calm down, Jenkins" said Dr. Alison. "If we tried to stop him, we would now be in the same place as your brother." "He’s got a point" said Dr. Espino. <br>"At least, we <em>had</em> the chance" said Brian. "Now we don’t even have that!"<br><br>
"Maybe that’s <em>not</em> true" said Dr. Espino. "There’s <em>still</em> a chance." Brian got confused. "Robert" said Brian. "What do you mean? How is it even <em>possible?</em> We already lost our chance, last night." "Don’t worry" said Dr. Alison. "Didn’t he tell you?" "No" said Brian. "What’s going on?" Dr. Alison looked at Dr. Espino with irritated eyes. "Umm" said Dr. Espino. "I <em>may</em> have forgot…" The moment he said the word "forgot" Dr. Alison screeched "I gave you only one job to do and you forgot!!!" Dr. Alison is usually a man of <em>great</em> calmness, but whenever he gets angry, he’s like a big volcano that keeps erupting forever.<br><br>
After about <em>an hour</em> or <em>more</em> of Dr. Alison’s anger at Dr. Espino, Brian finally asked "What was it that he was supposed to tell me?" "Well" Dr. Espino said, nervously. Dr. Alison looked at him with <em>eyes of thunder</em>, just waiting to <em>strike</em> with huge bolts of lightning. Frightened, Dr. Espino continued "We were thinking about how to save your brother and…" He stopped, <em>struck</em> by the <em>lightning</em> of Dr. Alison’s <em>frightening stare.</em> He gathered all of his strength and said "and we thought we could take help from <em>Jen.</em>" <br>Jen was the nickname of Jennifer Wilkins, a biologist and the head of the A.I branch of GTI.<br><br>
Later, they went to Jennifer’s room. "Dr. Wilkins" said Dr. Alison. "Please let us in." There was no answer. Dr. Alison had spoken pretty quietly but it was still clear. "Hey, Jen" yelled Brian and Dr. Espino. "Let us in!" "Be quiet, you two" said Dr. Alison. "A man from GTI should always remain <em>calm</em> and disciplined." Dr. Espino and Brian started giggling when he said <em>"calm"</em>. A voice came from the other room which asked "What’s going on?"<br><br>
Brian said "We were wondering if you could…" Jennifer interrupted him and said "Make a clone?" Brian said "We want you to <em>destroy</em> a clone." "What the heck" said Jennifer. "Where did even see a clone? Yesterday I told Jonas about how to make a clone. Later, he told me that he <em>destroyed</em> it. So it’s totally <em>impossible</em> that you saw that clone." So Dr. Espino, Dr. Alison and Brian told her about the previous night. <br>"So" said Jennifer. "That means <em>that</em> was the clone who said he destroyed himself. But why would he want to know the password of Dr. Jenkins’s old safe? And <em>why</em> did you <em>let</em> him torture Jonas like that?"<br><br>
"Well" said Dr. Espino.<br>"We weren’t prepared" said Dr. Alison. "It’s definitely too risky to do something without preparation." "It was an <em>emergency</em>, you morons" said Jennifer. "You don’t <em>calculate</em> risks when there’s an emergency!" "We <em>wanted</em> to help" said Brian and Dr. Espino. "He <em>didn’t</em> let us!" Dr. Alison felt highly insulted by all this accusation of the clone not being stopped his fault. He yelled "I <em>did</em> the right thing. If I wasn’t there, you two would be <em>roasted meat</em> by now!!! I <em>saved you</em> and <em>you</em> should be grateful!!!"<br><br>
Again after about an hour or more, <br>Dr. Alison <em>finally</em> calmed down. <br>Jennifer said "I think I <em>can</em> still help you."<br><br>
That night, they went to Jonas’s room again, <em>but this time</em> wearing clothes which were covered with water and high volts of electricity. They were <em>safe</em> from the electricity because there was a layer of plastic inside. They went inside and hid at the same place where they had hidden before. The clone came in. But <em>this</em> time, they didn’t stay hidden for long. When the clone opened the door of the new safe, they came out of hiding and pounced on the clone, who was <em>destroyed</em> the moment they touched him. They put on plastic overalls and quickly <em>freed</em> Jonas.<br><br>
Jonas asked them about how they destroyed the clone <em>just</em> by touching him. Brian said "The <strong>electricity</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>water</strong> from our clothes destroyed him. Jen can tell you more."<br><br>
"Hey look" said Jennifer. "I think someone hacked into your computer and changed the data stored for your clone."
</p>
<h6 class="ch" id="chapter3">The Hacker</h6>
<p>"No wonder it attacked me" said Jonas. Brian asked "What do you mean? A clone <em>can</em> do whatever it wants, right?" "That’s <em>true,</em> but only for 100% biological ones" said Jennifer. "Aren’t <em>all</em> clones biological?" asked Dr. Espino. "Not <em>all</em> of them" said Jennifer. "I invented a bio-robotic clone." <br><br>"Do you mean that…"began Dr. Espino. <br>"That you have <em>made</em> a clone too" Brian finished the sentence for Dr. Espino. "Well, <em>sort of</em>" said Jennifer. Dr. Alison said "What do you mean?" <br>"When I was programming the robotic features of the clone, something <em>weird</em> happened" said Jennifer. She gulped down the lump in her throat and stopped <em>struck</em> by fear.
    <br><br>"Go on" said the others. "Why did you stop?" <br>
"Shush" said Jennifer. There she gestured them to follow her outside. Dr. Alison was annoyed. So he yelled at her "This is still the time of working hour, yet <em>you…</em>" Jennifer interrupted him. "Be quiet" she whisper-shouted. "I <em>can’t</em> tell you about this here. It’s <em>too</em> risky." Then she quickly pushed everyone out of the room.<br><br>
Dr. Espino felt a bump on his bottom. He whisper-shouted at Jennifer "What’s your problem? The floor <em>ain’t</em> pillows." "Shush" whispered Jennifer. "There are matters <em>far</em> more important than your butt." <br>
"Shush" said Brian. "Can’t you two talk about something which <em>isn’t</em> someone’s butt? This is serious!!!"<br><br>
Later, they finally arrived at where Jennifer was taking them. It was a very dirty old house with a garden full of overgrown grass which was <em>one</em> of the reasons why it looked like a rotten jungle. It was <em>very</em> silent.<br><br>
Jennifer spoke "Who wants to stay here?" "You must be crazy" said Jonas. "Why in the world would we want to stay at a place like this? It’s like a <em>jungle-graveyard.</em>" "If none of you want to stay here, go get someone to hold on to our phones while we’re inside" said Jennifer.<br>
The others said "Why do we even have to do that?" Jennifer sighed. She said "Do you want to know about that almost-clone <em>clone</em> or not?" "Of course, we do" said Dr. Espino. "<em>But why</em> do we need to keep our phones away?" Jennifer said "I’ll tell <em>once</em> you keep them away."<br><br>
After a <em>lot</em> of persuasion, they finally gave their phones to Jonas. "<em>Hey</em>" said Jonas. "Why are you leaving me here? Can’t you <em>give</em> them to one of the people who’re wandering around?" <br>"You <em>already</em> know a lot of stuff about clones" said Jennifer. "And if we give them our phones they may steal them. So, don’t you dare give our phones to them." <br>Jonas said to himself "Oh, <em>why</em> did I make a clone in the first place?"<br><br>
The rest of them went inside. It was <em>even dirtier</em> inside. It was <em>so</em> dark that they felt like <em>blind people</em>. They had to <em>feel</em> their way around. None of the lights were working because, they had been broken <em>thousands</em> of years ago.<br><br>
Finally, Jennifer stepped on a rusty old torchlight. She picked it up and tried to turn it on. She had some batteries in her pockets. She <em>carefully sensed</em> her <em>way</em> to put them inside the torchlight. She turned them on. They could finally <em>see</em> what was around them.<br>
There were <em>dusty old</em> portraits in <em>dusty old</em> frames, <em>all</em> hanging over the stained walls. The floor was <em><strong>full</strong></em> of <em>broken</em> glass tiles, crunching as they stepped over them.<br>
Finally, they settled down at a <em>bleak</em> corner in what looked like the living room. The chairs were made of <em>rock,</em> with <em>dust</em> and <em>webs</em> all over. So they <em>reluctantly</em> sat on the floor.<br><br>
Jennifer finally began "While programing the clone, I got thirsty. So I got up and went to get a glass of water. While I was drinking, I suddenly heard a <em>loud</em> crashing sound from my room. It was <em>so</em> sudden that I <em>forgot</em> that I was holding the glass and <em>dropped</em> it. I rushed to my room and saw that the computer was programming <em>another</em> clone <em>all</em> by <em>itself</em>. <br>I tried to shut it down, but the mouse didn’t move according to my finger. It was moving <em>all by itself</em>. I couldn’t control the computer at all. And then, a voice came from the computer." 
<br>Brian asked "What did it say?"<br>
"It said that it was the clone" said Jennifer. "I <em>tried</em> my <em>best</em> to <em>delete</em> it, but for some reason, I couldn’t. Not even when the computer was working. I realized that the clone must have somehow <em>hacked</em> my computer. It said that it could travel through the internet to other computers and phones. That’s why I brought you here."<br><br>
Dr. Alison said "I <em>never</em> thought a <em>clone</em> could be a <em>digital hacker</em>."
</p>
<h6 class="ch" id="chapter4">Dr. Alison and Christy's<br>
    <em>Strange</em> Behavior
</h6>
<p>Later that night, Jennifer tried to delete the clown again. But the same thing happened, but <em>this time</em> she could contact with the clone. <em>So</em> she told the clone to leave, but as she had expected, it didn’t obey. But it <em>did</em> send a message saying "You think you can stop <em>us,</em> but you can’t. You totally wouldn’t be able to stop us when <em>we are all born.</em> So give up."<br>
    Jennifer typed "What do you mean by when we are all born?"<br>
She saw another message from the clone which said "You’ll see when the time comes. Until then, I wouldn’t want to ruin your surprise."<br>Jennifer typed "Just <em>tell</em> me."<br><br>
There was no reply. So she retyped it again and again, but no reply came. A robotic voice said "Your session is over. Try again tomorrow. But <em>remember,</em> don’t tell anyone about this or else you <em>will</em> be in big trouble." Jennifer was tired so she went to bed. But she left before the robotic voice said its last sentence. <em><strong>That</strong> perhaps,</em> was the reason why she had to experience such chaos in the upcoming days.<br><br>
The next day, Jennifer told her neighbor about the previous night and asked her if she could help. "I don’t think I can" said Christy Isabelle Jones, her neighbor. "But someone <strong>did</strong> tell me that <em>evil spirits</em> live in that dirty old house over there." She pointed to the house where Jennifer had told Dr. Espino, Dr. Alison and Brian about the clone. It wasn’t far from her house. Just a few blocks away.<br><br>
"I saw you going there, yesterday" she said. "Don’t go there again, unless you want to <em>die</em>."<br><br>
"Ghosts <em>don’t</em> exist" said Jennifer. "And since when do you have superstitions?" <br>Christy looked her with a frightening stare and said "This is <em>no</em> superstition. This <em>is</em> the truth." Jennifer literally thought that Christy’s eyes were shaped like <em>slimy balls slipping down</em> slowly like tears. <br>But then, she decided that she was just imagining it and said "You’re crazy" and left.<br><br>
When she arrived a GTI, she told Brian and Jonas about it. "Some people just believe everything" said Brian.<br><br>
Suddenly, Jennifer’s phone rang. She picked it up and found out that someone had accidentally made a group call. A <em>shrill</em> voice said "Hey! Is everything ready?" Another voice said "Not yet. I got only <em>one</em> of them." The second voice sounded very <em>familiar.</em> Jennifer said "Who <em>are</em> you?"<br><br>
The shrill voice said "<em>You</em> again! Go away!" Jennifer repeated her question. <br>But the shrill voice said "I <em>told</em> you to go away. Leave <em>or</em> else you’ll be in trouble." Jennifer told her that she wouldn’t leave until they answered her question. <br>Then her phone <em>shut</em> down <em>automatically.</em> No matter how hard she tried she couldn’t turn it on. She assumed it was out of charge. But she <em>had</em> charged it the whole night and plugged it out after eating breakfast. Brian and Jonas asked her what all the fuss was about. So she told them.<br><br>
They asked her if she’s got some luck finding out who had hacked into Jonas’s clone. "No" she said. "But something <em>did</em> happen." She told them about what happened the previous night.<br>
They asked her "Did you tell Dr. Alison or Robert about this?" "No" said Jennifer. "Well, you should" said Jonas. "Dr. Alison is the head of GTI so, he <em>knows</em> a lot of people who can help." <br>Jennifer said "By the way, have you <em>seen</em> Dr. Alison anywhere?"<br><br>
"Nope" said Brian. Jonas said "He <em>should</em> be here. After all, he’s <em>never</em> been so late before." "Maybe he’s with Robert" said Jennifer. "And even if he’s late, there’s no need to worry. I’m sure he’d hurry because he thinks his <em>dignity</em> is his <em>most prized possession.</em>"<br>
They went to Dr. Espino’s room but they <em>didn’t</em> find Dr. Alison. So they asked Dr. Espino if he had seen him. But as it turned out, Dr. Alison was <em>nowhere</em> in sight. They assumed that there was a lot of traffic and so, they waited. It was <em>5:30 pm </em>but Dr. Alison <em>still</em> didn’t come. By now, they had asked almost everyone in the <em>entire</em> building if they had seen Dr. Alison. Everyone said "No."<br><br>
At <em>last,</em> the end of working time came. Dr. Alison <em>still</em> hadn’t come. While Jennifer was going home she was stunned to see Dr. Alison walking on the street. He was <em>very</em> close to the dirty old house which, he <em>didn’t</em> want to <em>go to.</em> She called him and said "Why didn’t you come today?" Dr. Alison felt very irritated, <em>but</em> instead of yelling like he usually does, he <em>calmly</em> said in a <em>rough</em> tone "I got a <em>very</em> bad cold, <em>so</em> I couldn’t come." Jennifer was surprised. Dr. Alison looked <em>absolutely</em> healthy he didn’t <em>even</em> cough or sneeze. So she said "But you look all right to me. I think you’re <em>hallucinating</em> it." "Nonsense" said Dr. Alison. "I <em>am</em> sick." Then he <em>rushed</em> away. It was clear that he wasn’t sick at all. Jennifer wondered <em>why</em> he didn’t come and <em>why</em> he was hiding the reason from her.<br>
Christy had seen her. She angrily said "I told you <em>not</em> to go there! But you did!" Jennifer said "What’s <em>your</em> problem?" The moment she said it, Christy went inside her house and <em>slammed</em> the door shut.<br><br>
When she came home, she turned on her computer to see how things were going with the clone.
</p>
<h6 id="chapter5" class="ch">Jennifer's Bad Luck</h6>

<img class="left"src="https://1rqd2a.dm.files.1drv.com/y4mbMl6e43QQVxZSMjfpqGNLCT8DBziznD0CW4gpGIsirBclY0DJqtVHN9KZflaHLYHV9yO_fBztFa9fHtnHt5rpg7UoSQC9mFOBOSi67Z2N_weoieg52rRe5biTXQ4A6mW0WI_oxsJiWQTCRVGhFB_Jb1o_rxh-XiDM5brQTYmvScHNUyj55I4grewiPrjg5xbtiO4gbmJ43wLASzAe4a1aQ?width=591&height=377&cropmode=none" width="250" height="200" alt="Image"/>
She saw a message which told her to stay away from the dirty old house and <em>not</em> ask anyone why. So she typed" Does anyone else know about you?" <br>The computer <em>crashed</em>. She tried to fix it, but in <em>vain.</em> She tired and sleepy. She got up and went to bed.<br><br>
At the stroke of midnight, a <em>loud crash</em> was heard. Jennifer was woken by the immense noise which <em>ruined</em> the <em>peaceful</em> atmosphere. She reluctantly opened her eyes. She thought that her dog might have broken something. She rushed out and saw <em>fragments</em> of her computer’s broken screen <em>with</em> her dog too. So she scolded her dog and told it to get out. She screamed "Stay away until you’ve learnt your lesson. There were so many important things in that computer!"<br>
While she was taking her dog to its kennel, she heard a <em>loud cry</em> from the dirty old house. It sounded <em>very</em> familiar. She felt that it was someone, but wasn’t sure about her thoughts. So many things were happening. <em>Nothing</em> was making any sense. It was <em>no</em> dream because dreams are created by a person’s thoughts. If it was a dream, it was a dream that <em>followed no laws.</em> But it seemed so real. Yet, very different from the life she once knew.<br>
She decided it was just a really long nightmare. She ignored the noise and went back inside.<br><br>
The next morning was the beginning of the weekend. But, unlike other people who just relax and have fun during holidays, she went inside the <em>dirty old house</em> to find out the <em>reason</em> for the loud cry. It was as if the <em>house</em> was telling her to get out. Strong winds were forcing her out and the <em>familiar</em> voice was <em>in</em> the wind. It was as if that person was very close to her ears. She felt that she <em>knew</em> who it was, but her thoughts were <em>too</em> unbelievable. She didn’t know <em>if </em>she should believe. The voice spoke like <em>fiery strikes of thunder</em>, yet <em>very quiet</em> indeed. "I told you not to come" <em>hissed</em> the voice. "Go away. Or else you’ll be in big trouble."<br>
Jennifer asked "Who are you?"<br><br>
"You don’t need to know" said the <em>shrill voice of fire</em>. "Now get out!" A <em>huge</em> gust of wind pushed her out like the way a <em>monster could kick a speck of dust.</em> So she just went back home.<br><br>
While crossing the road a car <em>almost</em> crashed into her, but she <em>survived</em> with just a <em>little</em> twist in her ankle. She stood up, holding the traffic light stands and went to her home. Back home, she put on a bandage and sat on a couch and watched TV. But after a few seconds, the electricity went off. So she read a book. Suddenly, a <em>burning smell</em> came from under the couch. She looked under and<em> saw …</em><br><br>
"Hello" she said. "Is this the fire service? My house burning! Please hurry!" Then she told them her address. The firetruck was <em>seen</em> when the <em>entire</em> house looked like it was <em>made</em> of<em> fire.</em> But they <em>were</em> able to put it out. The house was <em>ruined.</em> So Jennifer had to<em> buy</em> furniture and doors, <em>etc.</em> She had to spend <em>all</em> the money which she had been <em>saving for a world-tour.</em><br>
It was the <em>worst</em> holiday ever. She wondered if it had something to do with the <em>clone, Christy or the voice.</em> Or maybe it was <em>all</em> just a coincidence. So many things were happening.<em> None </em>of them made any sense. The <em>world</em> was turning against her. The <em>entire</em> weekend was<em> nothing</em> but <em>bad</em> luck. Ever since, she’s having bad luck every day.<br>
She was having the <em>worst </em>time ever.<br><br>
One day, Dr. Espino, Brian and Jonas asked her why she was so glum, even though there were <em>just</em> a <em>few </em>days left for Halloween, which was her <em>favorite </em>time of year. She told them about all the bad luck she’s been having lately. <br>"<em>Geez, </em>that’s really bad" said Brian. <br>"What a bummer" said Dr. Espino. <br>"You are right, Robert" said Jonas. "<em>Very sad</em> indeed." <br>Dr. Alison saw this from a distance. He called the rest of them<em> without </em>Jennifer and told them to invent something. Brian asked "Is this a <em>challenge?</em>" Dr. Alison was annoyed and said "Yes."<br><br>
Jennifer was <em>left alone. </em>Dr. Alison had been avoiding her a <em>lot</em> lately. She wondered if she had done something bad without knowing. She hadn’t done much lately. She was always getting into trouble, nowadays. She asked Dr. Alison if she could take the day off. Dr. Alison <em>immediately</em> agreed. It was as if he had <em>always</em> wanted Jennifer to <em>get out of the building. </em>Jennifer went home, feeling guilty.<br><br>
Christy told her that this was <em>all </em>happening because Jennifer went to that house. "I <em>told</em> you to stay away, but you didn’t listen" she said. "Now you will have a miserable life <em>forever.</em>" When spoke her last sentence, she spoke it in the <em>shrill</em> voice of <em>fire.</em> Jennifer almost believed the voice belonged to Christy. But if it was hers, then <em>how </em>did she speak in the wind? How did it <em>all sound clear, across all that wind?</em> How on earth did she <em>control</em> the wind? Jennifer decided it was <em>all too much</em> to expect from a human being. She thought it was just her imagination.<br><br>
That night was different. It was <em>worse</em> than the previous ones. Jennifer had been<em> pushed </em>by something <em>so hard</em> that she fell on the floor and got a <em>nasty pain </em>in her back. She yelled "Ouch! Who did that?" She turned around. But there was<em> none </em>in sight. Her dog couldn’t have done it because it was in another room. But the<em> real </em>question was <em>"Who </em>did it?" There was <em>no</em>body in the house except Jennifer and her dog. She wasn’t near any windows or doors, so it wasn’t possible for someone to have pushed her and run away, unnoticed. But whoever did it,<em> was</em> unnoticed.
</p>
<h6 class="ch" id="chapter6">Everything Explained</h6>
<p>Later, her back started to hurt more. It was as if the pain was <em>spreading </em>to the rest of her body. It was <em>very</em> unbearable. She went out to that house again, because she was sure that there was some sort of <em>reasonable</em> explanation. She went in and said "Come out and <em>stop</em> putting me in trouble. Please, I can’t take it anymore, so <em>end</em> all of this." The <em>shrill </em>voice was heard again, fiercer than before. It said "<em>You </em>again! How many times do I have to tell you not to mingle in my business? Get out!" The <em>strong</em> wind blew again, but <em>this</em> time, Jennifer was wearing heavy clothes which held her to the ground. But the force of the wind was <em>still </em>too powerful. <em>Fortunately, </em>she fell on the mattress. She said "Why are you torturing me like this? What are you hiding that’s more important than a person’s life? This is madness!" The voice spoke in a <em>less </em>fierce, and <em>rather </em>disappointed tone "If you <em>knew </em>my secret, you wouldn’t say what you said last. I must hide it at all costs, or else, there’s<em> nothing."</em><br><br>
Jennifer was in awe. The wind blew again forcing her out. She saw a <em>shadowy</em> figure in the darkness, <em>full </em>of depression. "Go away" said the depressing voice of the <em>shadowy</em> figure which slowly disappeared. "And <em>never </em>come back." Jennifer said "I’m not leaving, <em>until </em>you <em>stop</em> torturing me <em>or </em>tell me your secret." The voice said "I can’t." Jennifer didn’t believe. "You’re <em>lying" </em>she said. "Of course you <em>can </em>stop it."<br>
"If you<em> really </em>want to know my secret so bad," said the voice. "come here at midnight. But first you must <em>promise </em>me that you won’t tell anyone about this." Jennifer was a bit irritated when she found out that she had to make a promise. But maybe, if she found out the secret, she might be able to guess how to get rid of her bad luck. So she reluctantly agreed.<br><br>
The next day, after work, she quickly went home as usual. But<em> this time,</em> she went to bed early. At the stroke of 12:00, her alarm ringed. She turned it off and went into that house only a torchlight in her hand. She was<em> very </em>tired. So she sat on a bed and said "I’m<em> here.</em> Now tell me what you<em> hide." </em>The voice said "Are you <em>sure</em> you want to know? It’s not a pretty story." Jennifer said "I’m <em>sure."</em> Jennifer felt her hand being pulled. "If that’s the case, let me<em> show</em> you why you wouldn’t want to know" said the voice, pulling her to a place which had not yet been told. The owner of the voice took her to a<em> dark and shabby </em>room. There was a locked coffin in the corner. Jennifer asked "Why did bring me here?" The voice said "To <em>show</em> you."<br><br>
Before she could say another word, Jennifer was dragged inside the coffin. She couldn’t see who’s it was. Her torchlight had fallen out of her hand and had<em> broken.</em> When she touched the coffin floor,<em> everything began to fade.</em> They were no longer in the coffin. They were in another place. The darkness was gone and light filled the sky. She saw a girl who looked very familiar. She was in a room where very little light existed. She was very excited. A much older woman came inside. "Come on" said the woman. "It’s time." The little girl was very happy. "This isn’t so bad" said Jennifer to the unknown voice. "Is that <em>you?"</em><br>
"Yes" said the voice. "Don’t underestimate what happened next. It’s very bad." The room faded. They were now in an amusement park. This was a very cheerful atmosphere. What happened next was horrible. It came without warning. It destroyed the little girl’s heart. It was horrible.<br><br>
The scene of the heartbreaking death was disappeared. The little girl was now in a dark room, crying. The other children were playing in the backyard. Seeing this, she remembered her good times in the past. She cried even harder. "I was heartbroken, just melting the way butter on a stove melts" said the voice. "It’s almost dawn. We need to go. I’m sure you understand why it’s not a good tale to listen to." The room faded. They were back at the dirty old house. Jennifer went home.<br>
She decided she would come <em>back again.</em><br><br>
She went to the lab and asked Dr. Alison if she could go home early. Brian, Jonas and Dr. Espino asked her what was going on. "It’s a<em> secret" </em>said Jennifer. The rest of them became annoyed. Jennifer felt uncomfortable.<br><br>
That night, she went back. "I’m back" she said. "I just want to hear the rest of the story." <br>Strong winds pushed her. She spoke even louder. But winds pushed her still. She repeated what she said. But the winds blew harder still. This happened a few more times. Jennifer said "Just tell me what happened next." Finally, the voice said "You already know it’s <em>not</em> a good tale. But <em>why</em> do you <em>still </em>want to hear it?" Jennifer said "I just want to get rid of my bad luck." The voice said "I told you that I <em>can’t </em>remove your bad luck. So leave me alone." Jennifer said "What if there’s a clue?" "I don’t think so" said the voice. "That story is nothing but a reminder of my <em>miserable life.</em>" Jennifer kept persuading her more<em> and </em>more. Finally, the voice agreed.<br><br>
"After my family’s death, I had to stay at the orphanage" began the voice. "I was very sad about it.<em> Even</em> in the orphanage, everyone was very mean. I had to stay there until I was adopted. But when I was, I committed suicide. Fortunately, my spirit was put in the computer in your house. But I couldn’t<em> do</em> anything until you programmed the clone. I stole its soul and made it mine. Then I went inside your neighbor’s soul. But I couldn’t stay there <em>forever.</em> So in the morning I’m in her body and in the middle of the night, your computer. But your computer was broken a few days ago. So I have to be in what I’m in right now every night. I don’t know why I still exist, but when I was alive, I saw a necklace in the beach. I liked it a lot so I kept it. After 1-3 years, an antique seller told me that it was an <em>enchanted </em>necklace. But I<em> don’t </em>think that’s true."

<p>Jennifer was <em>horrified. </em>"That was horrible" she said. "Just because you were suffering doesn’t mean others should suffer." The voice said "Now that you know this, your<em> end </em>is <em>now.</em>" Jennifer watched as a huge snake, a <em>devastatingly </em>horrid monster, and more came to<em> kill </em>her. But she managed to get away. The monsters couldn’t live outside the house, so she was safe.<br>
She ran away and<em> didn’t </em>come back.<br><br>
The next day, she went to GTI and everyone asked her about the scars all over her, which were from the dirty old house. "I wish I’ve told you, but I <em>promised </em>that I won’t" said Jennifer whenever someone asked. She sighed and sat down in her room, exhausted from the midnight chase. Surprisingly, Dr. Alison wasn’t acting weird anymore. He was acting <em>just the way he used to, not so long ago.</em> Everything was back to normal. Jennifer felt relieved that all that chaos had ended. Her computer wasn’t crazy anymore. She could do whatever she wanted, whenever she wanted in her computer, just the way she could, before all of it. Life was just the way it used to be, before the clone was<em> born.</em><br>
Life was absolutely perfect.<br>
There was nothing to worry about,<br>
Everything was just the way,<br>
It was before that day.<br>
Nothing to worry about,<br>
Absolutely perfect,<br>
Just the way it was.<br>
Nothing could ruin it, because a<br>
Perfect day it was.<br><br>
Jennifer went home,<em> full </em>of happiness. She was very happy. So she wasn’t scared anymore. Nor was she worried, so she did what she wanted to, unlike a night ago. She was having the best time in her entire life. She decided to have a big party for this. She told Christy to stay away from her(Christy's) house and go there only at night. Christy disagreed so Jennifer told her that she would bring something of Christy’s choice at the party. But it didn’t work. So she kept persuading her on and on until finally, she agreed. "See you there" said Jennifer and left. "And don’t forget to stay away."<br><br>
There were a<em> ton more </em>parties that week. After all, <em>anyone</em> would be as excited as they were to lose such a huge amount of worries. The entire week was<em> full of fun. </em>The shopkeepers got a lot of money from selling party items. So they kept selling them more <em>and</em> more.<br>
After a few more weeks, on another day, which was<em> expected to be good,</em> Jennifer had noticed that Christy was always a little mad at her. But for <em>some reason </em>she tried to hide it. So Jennifer asked her why. "You don’t need to know" said Christy and slammed the door in her face. Jennifer knocked on the door. But Christy didn’t reply. So Jennifer knocked it again. This happened a few more times. "Please, stop" said Christy. "Go away." As it got <em>darker, </em>Jennifer got<em> sleepier. </em>So she left.<br><br>
The next night, she slowly <em>snuck </em>into Christy’s house. When it was midnight, Christy went outside. Jennifer followed her. Christy was heading right towards the dirty old house. Jennifer felt scared, on account of what happened last time. But she<em> braved her fear out. </em>Christy went<em> inside </em>the coffin. Then a spirit emerged from her. Jennifer used to think that at night, the spirit just came out of Christy’s body and <em>then </em>went to that house. When she felt that the spirit wasn’t there, she went near the coffin and tried to wake Christy up. But it didn’t work. She saw Christy’s name engraved on the coffin. At last she pulled Christy out of the house. But then she heard the voice say "Don’t take away my body, please. The story I told you was a lie. Please, or else you won’t have this neighbor anymore."<br>
Jennifer said "I’m not falling for another one of your tricks again." "This is<em> no </em>trick" said the voice. "I<em> promise.</em> Please, you’re making a <em>huge mistake."</em> Jennifer decided she should give it a try, <em>especially</em> because of the promise. She went inside with Christy’s body. The voice said "All you saw was a <em>mere show in your eyes,</em> created by me. But this is true. I<em> am Christy </em>and story you saw isn’t true. I died from a car crash. But I am safe,<em> all </em>because of the ruby in the necklace dangling in my neck. I pretend it is just like any other sort of jewelry but it has<em> saved </em>my life."<br>
Jennifer asked "But how can a ruby save your life?" Christy said "It’s a long story. I’ll tell you tomorrow after you come back from work. I don’t want to say it over the phone." Jennifer felt relieved that the old story wasn’t true.
