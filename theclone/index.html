<h4 id="chapter1"class="ch">The Beginning</h4>
<p>Jonas Jenkins loved to take risks. So, he decided to make a clone of himself. He scanned his body and made similar components to make it. But, he was unaware of one thing. After he put artificial blood inside, he said "This looks just like me!!! So he should be like me." He turned it on...<br><br>
"Dr. Jenkins has been acting in a very weird way, these days." said Dr. Alison. He was the head of GTL, the company for which Jonas used to work. "He doesn’t deserve to work at a place like Great Tech Labs." said Dr. Espino. "Don't be so hard on him. " said Dr. Alison." Maybe, he’s been going through a lot of work. He must be tired. " "I wouldn’t say that if I were you" said Brian Jenkins, Jonas’s brother. "He’s been acting pretty weird out of the lab too. Even, at parties."<br><br>
"Maybe, we should check on him" said Dr. Espino. "I don’t think that’s a good idea, Robert" said Brian. "He goes crazy whenever somebody is near his lab." "We must take this risk" said Dr. Alison. "It’s our only chance." <br>So, Brian reluctantly agreed.<br>
    <br>That night, they slowly snuck into Jonas’s room. They hid behind the shelves, since there was no other good hiding place for them.Footsteps came rustling inside.<br><br>
"Be quiet" whispered Brian to the others. "If we get caught it would all be your fault, Robert!" Dr. Espino got really angry and whisper-yelled at him. "If you two keep fighting we would surely get caught" whispered Dr. Alison. "And it would all be your fault!"
<br><br>
"Shush" whispered Brian. "Look! I think he’s doing something!!!" They saw Jonas opening the new safe which an inch taller than him. The noise of a struggling prisoner filled their ears.<br>
"Be quiet" said the <em>clone…</em>
</p>
<h5 class="ch" id="chapter2">The Rescue</h5>
<p>"We can’t let that clone get away with this" said Brian, the next day. "If it weren’t for <em>you </em>we would have stopped him when we had the chance." "Calm down, Jenkins" said Dr. Alison. "If we tried to stop him, we would now be in the same place as your brother." "He’s got a point" said Dr. Espino. <br>"At least, we <em>had</em> the chance" said Brian. "Now we don’t even have that!"<br><br>
"Maybe that’s <em>not</em> true" said Dr. Espino. "There’s <em>still</em> a chance." Brian got confused. "Robert" said Brian. "What do you mean? How is it even <em>possible?</em> We already lost our chance, last night." "Don’t worry" said Dr. Alison. "Didn’t he tell you?" "No" said Brian. "What’s going on?" Dr. Alison looked at Dr. Espino with irritated eyes. "Umm" said Dr. Espino. "I <em>may</em> have forgot…" The moment he said the word "forgot" Dr. Alison screeched "I gave you only one job to do and you forgot!!!" Dr. Alison is usually a man of <em>great</em> calmness, but whenever he gets angry, he’s like a big volcano that keeps erupting forever.<br><br>
After about <em>an hour</em> or <em>more</em> of Dr. Alison’s anger at Dr. Espino, Brian finally asked "What was it that he was supposed to tell me?" "Well" Dr. Espino said, nervously. Dr. Alison looked at him with <em>eyes of thunder</em>, just waiting to <em>strike</em> with huge bolts of lightning. Frightened, Dr. Espino continued "We were thinking about how to save your brother and…" He stopped, <em>struck</em> by the <em>lightning</em> of Dr. Alison’s <em>frightening stare.</em> He gathered all of his strength and said "and we thought we could take help from <em>Jen.</em>" <br>Jen was the nickname of Jennifer Wilkins, a biologist and the head of the A.I branch of GTI.<br><br>
Later, they went to Jennifer’s room. "Dr. Wilkins" said Dr. Alison. "Please let us in." There was no answer. Dr. Alison had spoken pretty quietly but it was still clear. "Hey, Jen" yelled Brian and Dr. Espino. "Let us in!" "Be quiet, you two" said Dr. Alison. "A man from GTI should always remain <em>calm</em> and disciplined." Dr. Espino and Brian started giggling when he said <em>"calm"</em>. A voice came from the other room which asked "What’s going on?"<br><br>
Brian said "We were wondering if you could…" Jennifer interrupted him and said "Make a clone?" Brian said "We want you to <em>destroy</em> a clone." "What the heck" said Jennifer. "Where did even see a clone? Yesterday I told Jonas about how to make a clone. Later, he told me that he <em>destroyed</em> it. So it’s totally <em>impossible</em> that you saw that clone." So Dr. Espino, Dr. Alison and Brian told her about the previous night. <br>"So" said Jennifer. "That means <em>that</em> was the clone who said he destroyed himself. But why would he want to know the password of Dr. Jenkins’s old safe? And <em>why</em> did you <em>let</em> him torture Jonas like that?"<br><br>
"Well" said Dr. Espino.<br>"We weren’t prepared" said Dr. Alison. "It’s definitely too risky to do something without preparation." "It was an <em>emergency</em>, you morons" said Jennifer. "You don’t <em>calculate</em> risks when there’s an emergency!" "We <em>wanted</em> to help" said Brian and Dr. Espino. "He <em>didn’t</em> let us!" Dr. Alison felt highly insulted by all this accusation of the clone not being stopped his fault. He yelled "I <em>did</em> the right thing. If I wasn’t there, you two would be <em>roasted meat</em> by now!!! I <em>saved you</em> and <em>you</em> should be grateful!!!"<br><br>
Again after about an hour or more, <br>Dr. Alison <em>finally</em> calmed down. <br>Jennifer said "I think I <em>can</em> still help you."<br><br>
That night, they went to Jonas’s room again, <em>but this time</em> wearing clothes which were covered with water and high volts of electricity. They were <em>safe</em> from the electricity because there was a layer of plastic inside. They went inside and hid at the same place where they had hidden before. The clone came in. But <em>this</em> time, they didn’t stay hidden for long. When the clone opened the door of the new safe, they came out of hiding and pounced on the clone, who was <em>destroyed</em> the moment they touched him. They put on plastic overalls and quickly <em>freed</em> Jonas.<br><br>
Jonas asked them about how they destroyed the clone <em>just</em> by touching him. Brian said "The <strong>electricity</strong> <em>and</em> <strong>water</strong> from our clothes destroyed him. Jen can tell you more."<br><br>
"Hey look" said Jennifer. "I think someone hacked into your computer and changed the data stored for your clone."
</p>
<h6 class="ch" id="chapter3">The Hacker</h6>
<p>"No wonder it attacked me" said Jonas. Brian asked "What do you mean? A clone <em>can</em> do whatever it wants, right?" "That’s <em>true,</em> but only for 100% biological ones" said Jennifer. "Aren’t <em>all</em> clones biological?" asked Dr. Espino. "Not <em>all</em> of them" said Jennifer. "I invented a bio-robotic clone." <br><br>"Do you mean that…"began Dr. Espino. <br>"That you have <em>made</em> a clone too" Brian finished the sentence for Dr. Espino. "Well, <em>sort of</em>" said Jennifer. Dr. Alison said "What do you mean?" <br>"When I was programming the robotic features of the clone, something <em>weird</em> happened" said Jennifer. She gulped down the lump in her throat and stopped <em>struck</em> by fear.
    <br><br>"Go on" said the others. "Why did you stop?" <br>
"Shush" said Jennifer. There she gestured them to follow her outside. Dr. Alison was annoyed. So he yelled at her "This is still the time of working hour, yet <em>you…</em>" Jennifer interrupted him. "Be quiet" she whisper-shouted. "I <em>can’t</em> tell you about this here. It’s <em>too</em> risky." Then she quickly pushed everyone out of the room.<br><br>
Dr. Espino felt a bump on his bottom. He whisper-shouted at Jennifer "What’s your problem? The floor <em>ain’t</em> pillows." "Shush" whispered Jennifer. "There are matters <em>far</em> more important than your butt." <br>
"Shush" said Brian. "Can’t you two talk about something which <em>isn’t</em> someone’s butt? This is serious!!!"<br><br>
Later, they finally arrived at where Jennifer was taking them. It was a very dirty old house with a garden full of overgrown grass which was <em>one</em> of the reasons why it looked like a rotten jungle. It was <em>very</em> silent.<br><br>
Jennifer spoke "Who wants to stay here?" "You must be crazy" said Jonas. "Why in the world would we want to stay at a place like this? It’s like a <em>jungle-graveyard.</em>" "If none of you want to stay here, go get someone to hold on to our phones while we’re inside" said Jennifer.<br>
The others said "Why do we even have to do that?" Jennifer sighed. She said "Do you want to know about that almost-clone <em>clone</em> or not?" "Of course, we do" said Dr. Espino. "<em>But why</em> do we need to keep our phones away?" Jennifer said "I’ll tell <em>once</em> you keep them away."<br><br>
After a <em>lot</em> of persuasion, they finally gave their phones to Jonas. "<em>Hey</em>" said Jonas. "Why are you leaving me here? Can’t you <em>give</em> them to one of the people who’re wandering around?" <br>"You <em>already</em> know a lot of stuff about clones" said Jennifer. "And if we give them our phones they may steal them. So, don’t you dare give our phones to them." <br>Jonas said to himself "Oh, <em>why</em> did I make a clone in the first place?"<br><br>
The rest of them went inside. It was <em>even dirtier</em> inside. It was <em>so</em> dark that they felt like <em>blind people</em>. They had to <em>feel</em> their way around. None of the lights were working because, they had been broken <em>thousands</em> of years ago.<br><br>
Finally, Jennifer stepped on a rusty old torchlight. She picked it up and tried to turn it on. She had some batteries in her pockets. She <em>carefully sensed</em> her <em>way</em> to put them inside the torchlight. She turned them on. They could finally <em>see</em> what was around them.<br>
There were <em>dusty old</em> portraits in <em>dusty old</em> frames, <em>all</em> hanging over the stained walls. The floor was <em><strong>full</strong></em> of <em>broken</em> glass tiles, crunching as they stepped over them.<br>
Finally, they settled down at a <em>bleak</em> corner in what looked like the living room. The chairs were made of <em>rock,</em> with <em>dust</em> and <em>webs</em> all over. So they <em>reluctantly</em> sat on the floor.<br><br>
Jennifer finally began "While programing the clone, I got thirsty. So I got up and went to get a glass of water. While I was drinking, I suddenly heard a <em>loud</em> crashing sound from my room. It was <em>so</em> sudden that I <em>forgot</em> that I was holding the glass and <em>dropped</em> it. I rushed to my room and saw that the computer was programming <em>another</em> clone <em>all</em> by <em>itself</em>. <br>I tried to shut it down, but the mouse didn’t move according to my finger. It was moving <em>all by itself</em>. I couldn’t control the computer at all. And then, a voice came from the computer." 
<br>Brian asked "What did it say?"<br>
"It said that it was the clone" said Jennifer. "I <em>tried</em> my <em>best</em> to <em>delete</em> it, but for some reason, I couldn’t. Not even when the computer was working. I realized that the clone must have somehow <em>hacked</em> my computer. It said that it could travel through the internet to other computers and phones. That’s why I brought you here."<br><br>
Dr. Alison said "I <em>never</em> thought a <em>clone</em> could be a <em>digital hacker</em>."
</p>
<h6 class="ch" id="chapter4">Dr. Alison and Christy's<br>
    Strange Behavior
</h6>
<p>Later that night, Jennifer tried to delete the clown again. But the same thing happened, but <em>this time</em> she could contact with the clone. <em>So</em> she told the clone to leave, but as she had expected, it didn’t obey. But it <em>did</em> send a message saying "You think you can stop <em>us,</em> but you can’t. You totally wouldn’t be able to stop us when <em>we are all born.</em> So give up."<br>
    Jennifer typed "What do you mean by when we are all born?"<br>
She saw another message from the clone which said "You’ll see when the time comes. Until then, I wouldn’t want to ruin your surprise."<br>Jennifer typed "Just <em>tell</em> me."<br><br>
There was no reply. So she retyped it again and again, but no reply came. A robotic voice said "Your session is over. Try again tomorrow. But <em>remember,</em> don’t tell anyone about this or else you <em>will</em> be in big trouble." Jennifer was tired so she went to bed. But she left before the robotic voice said its last sentence. <em><strong>That</strong> perhaps,</em> was the reason why she had to experience such chaos in the upcoming days.<br><br>
The next day, Jennifer told her neighbor about the previous night and asked her if she could help. "I don’t think I can" said Christy Isabelle Jones, her neighbor. "But someone <strong>did</strong> tell me that <em>evil spirits</em> live in that dirty old house over there." She pointed to the house where Jennifer had told Dr. Espino, Dr. Alison and Brian about the clone. It wasn’t far from her house. Just a few blocks away.<br><br>
"I saw you going there, yesterday" she said. "Don’t go there again, unless you want to <em>die</em>."<br><br>
"Ghosts <em>don’t</em> exist" said Jennifer. "And since when do you have superstitions?" <br>Christy looked her with a frightening stare and said "This is <em>no</em> superstition. This <em>is</em> the truth." Jennifer literally thought that Christy’s eyes were shaped like <em>slimy balls slipping down</em> slowly like tears. <br>But then, she decided that she was just imagining it and said "You’re crazy" and left.<br><br>
When she arrived a GTI, she told Brian and Jonas about it. "Some people just believe everything" said Brian.<br><br>
Suddenly, Jennifer’s phone rang. She picked it up and found out that someone had accidentally made a group call. A <em>shrill</em> voice said "Hey! Is everything ready?" Another voice said "Not yet. I got only <em>one</em> of them." The second voice sounded very <em>familiar.</em> Jennifer said "Who <em>are</em> you?"<br><br>
The shrill voice said "<em>You</em> again! Go away!" Jennifer repeated her question. <br>But the shrill voice said "I <em>told</em> you to go away. Leave <em>or</em> else you’ll be in trouble." Jennifer told her that she wouldn’t leave until they answered her question. <br>Then her phone <em>shut</em> down <em>automatically.</em> No matter how hard she tried she couldn’t turn it on. She assumed it was out of charge. But she <em>had</em> charged it the whole night and plugged it out after eating breakfast. Brian and Jonas asked her what all the fuss was about. So she told them.<br><br>
They asked her if she’s got some luck finding out who had hacked into Jonas’s clone. "No" she said. "But something <em>did</em> happen." She told them about what happened the previous night.<br>
They asked her "Did you tell Dr. Alison or Robert about this?" "No" said Jennifer. "Well, you should" said Jonas. "Dr. Alison is the head of GTI so, he <em>knows</em> a lot of people who can help." <br>Jennifer said "By the way, have you <em>seen</em> Dr. Alison anywhere?"<br><br>
"Nope" said Brian. Jonas said "He <em>should</em> be here. After all, he’s <em>never</em> been so late before." "Maybe he’s with Robert" said Jennifer. "And even if he’s late, there’s no need to worry. I’m sure he’d hurry because he thinks his <em>dignity</em> is his <em>most prized possession.</em>"<br>
They went to Dr. Espino’s room but they <em>didn’t</em> find Dr. Alison. So they asked Dr. Espino if he had seen him. But as it turned out, Dr. Alison was <em>nowhere</em> in sight. They assumed that there was a lot of traffic and so, they waited. It was <em>5:30 pm </em>but Dr. Alison <em>still</em> didn’t come. By now, they had asked almost everyone in the <em>entire</em> building if they had seen Dr. Alison. Everyone said "No."<br><br>
At <em>last,</em> the end of working time came. Dr. Alison <em>still</em> hadn’t come. While Jennifer was going home she was stunned to see Dr. Alison walking on the street. He was <em>very</em> close to the dirty old house which, he <em>didn’t</em> want to <em>go to.</em> She called him and said "Why didn’t you come today?" Dr. Alison felt very irritated, <em>but</em> instead of yelling like he usually does, he <em>calmly</em> said in a <em>rough</em> tone "I got a <em>very</em> bad cold, <em>so</em> I couldn’t come." Jennifer was surprised. Dr. Alison looked <em>absolutely</em> healthy he didn’t <em>even</em> cough or sneeze. So she said "But you look all right to me. I think you’re <em>hallucinating</em> it." "Nonsense" said Dr. Alison. "I <em>am</em> sick." Then he <em>rushed</em> away. It was clear that he wasn’t sick at all. Jennifer wondered <em>why</em> he didn’t come and <em>why</em> he was hiding the reason from her.<br>
Christy had seen her. She angrily said "I told you <em>not</em> to go there! But you did!" Jennifer said "What’s <em>your</em> problem?" The moment she said it, Christy went inside her house and <em>slammed</em> the door shut.<br><br>
When she came home, she turned on her computer to see how things were going with the clone.
</p>
<h6 id="chapter5" class="ch">?</h6>
<p>She saw a message which told her to stay away from the dirty old house and not ask anyone why.
